    <h2>Heat map</h2>
    <p>With a heat map (or attention map) visualization the eye tracking data can be read easily. The visualization shows the general focus of the visual attention on the image. It uses a red-yellow-green color scheme for the duration of the eye movement. The green indicates no attention of the eye-tracking data and the red spots got the most attention. </p>
    <!--  <p>One of the techniques to visualize the eye scan data is by using a heat map (or attention map). It is a simple visualization to read, because it shows the general focus of visual attention on an image. It shows the image and slightly colors important spots in the color scheme red-yellow-green. These important spots are based on the duration that a person focused on it.</p>-->

    <h2>Gaze plot</h2>
    <p>A gaze plot visualizes the path followed by the participant's eyes during a given task. A gaze plot is a type of scan path and it shows the individual focus of each location. The visualization shows the image on the background, overlaid with stripes and dots. The dots represent the fixations points and the lines the connections towards the next fixation. In this way you can see the path the eye follows on an image, put in chronological order. </p>
    <!--<p> Another well-known visualization technique for eye movement is a gaze plot. A gaze plot is a type of scan path. It differs from the rest, because the order between the eye movement is important. Furthermore, it shows the individual focus of each location. It does this by showing the image on the background, overlaid with stripes and dots. The dots represent all the individual focus points and these are numbered. The stripes are simply connections between the dots.</p>-->

    <h2>Parallel scan path</h2>
      <p>The parallel scan path visualization focuses on areas of interests (AOIs), instead of individual fixation points. It exists out of vertical lines which shift between the different AOIs horizontally. The timelaps of the parallel scan path starts at the top and ends at the bottom. </p>

  <div class="text_4">
    <h2>Scarf plot</h2>
      <p>The scarf plot makes, just like the parallel scan path, use of AOIs. In the scarf plot you can recognize the areas of interest on the image as colored borders. Below the image, lies a horizontal box, one for every participant. The focus of the eyes are given for each participant in an individual timelaps. The colors of the AOIs are represented as focus spots of the eyes in chronological order.</p>
