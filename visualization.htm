    <h2>Heat map</h2>
    <p>With a heat map (or attention map) visualization the eye tracking data can be read easily. The visualization shows the general focus of the visual attention on the image. It shows a red-yellow-green color scheme in which the red indicates no attention of the eye tracking data on the image, and the green spots get the most attention. The color is choosen on the image based on place of the eye and duration of this moment.</p>
    <!--  <p>One of the techniques to visualize the eye scan data is by using a heat map (or attention map). It is a simple visualization to read, because it shows the general focus of visual attention on an image. It shows the image and slightly colors important spots in the color scheme red-yellow-green. These important spots are based on the duration that a person focused on it.</p>-->

    <h2>Gaze plot</h2>
    <p>A gaze plot visualizes the path followed by the participant's eyes during a given task. A gaze plot is a type of scan path, and  it shows the individual focus of each location.  The visualization shows the image on the background, overlaid with stripes and dots. The dots are the fixations points, and the lines are the connection towards the next fixation. In this way you can see the path the eye follows on an image. </p>
    <!--  <p>Another well-known visualization technique for eye movement is a gaze plot. A gaze plot is a type of scan path. It differs from the rest, because the order between the eye movement is important. Furthermore, it shows the individual focus of each location. It does this by showing the image on the background, overlaid with stripes and dots. The dots represent all the individual focus points and these are numbered. The stripes are simply connections between the dots.</p>-->

    <h2>Parallel scan path</h2>
      <p>The parallel scan path visualization focuses on areas of interest (AOI). It exists out of vertical lines which shifts between the different AOIs horizontally. The timelaps of the parallel scan path begins in the top and will go overtime to the bottom. The parallel scan path does not focus on the points on the image direclty, but on the AOIs of the iamge.</p>

    <h2>Scarf plot</h2>
      <p>The scarf plot makes like the parellel scan path use of OAIs. In the scarf plot you can see the areas of interest on the image as colored boxes. underneath the image is a horizontal box for every participant. The focus of the eyes are given for each participant in a individual timelaps in which the colors of the OAIs are represented as place of focus of the eyes in chronological order.</p>
