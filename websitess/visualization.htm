  				<h2>Heat map</h2>
          <p>One of the techniques to visualize the eye scan data is by using a heat map (or attention map). It is a simple visualization to read, because it shows the general focus of visual attention on an image. It shows the image and slightly colors important spots in the color scheme red-yellow-green. These important spots are based on the duration that a person focused on it.</p>

  				<h2>Gaze plot</h2>
          <p>Another well-known visualization technique for eye movement is a gaze plot. This is a type of scan path. It differs from the rest, because the order between the eye movement is important. Furthermore, it shows the individual focus of each location. It does this by showing the image on the background, overlaid with stripes and dots. The dots represent all the individual focus points and these are numbered. The stripes are simply connections between the dots.</p>
