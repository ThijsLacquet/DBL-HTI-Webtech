    <h1>What to find on this site.</h1>
    <p>Eye-tracking can be visualized in different ways. First of all do you
      need to store the data of the eye-tracking to make visualizations out of
      it. With eye-tracking visualizations you could for instance see where the
       visual interests of people lay on for example a movie poster. </p>
    <p>On this page you can find the four different visualization tools you can
       use to visualize eye-tracking. The different kinds of visualizations and
       description of what they visualize can be found under the head
       "Visualization". On this site you can make of your own eye-tracking
       visualizations. To do this you need to go to the head "Upload", and
       upload your data and the visualization you want.</p>
