Go to hti.lacquet.nl to open the visualization tool.

Make sure you have cookies turned on, otherwise the visualization tool will not work.

Uploading data:
- On the uploadpage you can upload your data. When both a csv and atleast one image file have been uploaded, you will be redirected to the visualization page.
- Uploading data can take a minute, because the webserver is hosted on a low end development board. When the webserver is hosted on the tue laptop, uploading the data takes less than two seconds.
- Users are identified using cookies. You cannot access the data of someone else, and your uploaded data stays on the webserver for 24 hours. So you can come back later to continue using the visualization tool.
